_An anonymous feedback app_
 -- http://bolnabhai.herokuapp.com

# What is Bol Na Bhai?

Bol Na Bhai is an application where you can give and receive annonymouse feedback. After registering for an account, a link will be created which you can share on Facebook, Twitter, or give directly to friends or coworkers.

Using this link, any person can give honest feedback to you using a simple form on the Bol Na Bhai website. That feedback will then show on your personal profile. You can use that feedback to improve yourself and become a better person.

> We all need people who will give us feedback. That’s how we improve.
> — Bill Gates

# Why Anonymous Feedback?

Giving feedback can be very difficult to a person face-to-face. Often you may not feel we can be open and honest because of fear of hurting the receiver's feelings or because of a fear of retribution or the possibility of losing a friend.

Allowing the feedback to be entirely anonymous it protects both the sender and the receiver of feedback. The person can send feedback to their friend, family member, or coworker without them know it was you who sent it. This allows the receiver to accept that feedback and work to better themselves.

# Features
